/**
 * A class that represents a {@link SubsystemBase} with a state machine implementation. By default,
 * this state machine periodically updates its inputs and current state via the {@link
 * CommandScheduler}. If input updates need to be manually managed (e.g., in a time-based robot or a
 * robot-wide state machine), use a {@link ManagedStateMachine}.
 *
 * <p>The default behavior of the state machine proceeds through the following steps during each
 * command-based robot code loop:
 *
 * <ol>
 *   <li>When the {@link CommandScheduler} runs, it calls each subsystem's {@link #periodic()}
 *       method in an arbitrary order. For a state machine, this {@link #periodic()} method updates
 *       inputs and transitions to a new state if the current state has completed or its goal has
 *       been reached. This is most useful when transitioning between primary states automatically
 *       after a transition goal is reached.
 *   <li>After all subsystem periodic methods have run, scheduled commands are executed, which may
 *       update the states of subsystems or state machines.
 *   <li>Whenever a state is updated using {@link #setState(S)}, the state machine attempts to *
 *       transition to the new state immediately. If a direct transition is not possible, a *
 *       "transition" state (determined by {@link #getTransitionState(S)}) is set as the current *
 *       state instead. This evaluation happens instantly upon calling {@link #setState(S)}, not *
 *       during the next periodic loop, allowing the controls to be immediately updated.
 * </ol>

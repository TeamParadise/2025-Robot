/**
 * A class that represents a {@link SubsystemBase} with a state machine implementation. This state
 * machine periodically updates its inputs via the {@link CommandScheduler}.
 *
 * <p>If you want to have a state machine that supports state overrides (manual control outside a
 * {@link RobotManager}), use a {@link OverridableStateMachine}.
 *
 * <p>The default behavior of the state machine proceeds through the following steps during each
 * command-based robot code loop:
 *
 * <ol>
 *   <li>When the {@link CommandScheduler} runs, it calls each subsystem's {@link #periodic()}
 *       method in an arbitrary order. For a state machine, this {@link #periodic()} method updates
 *       inputs.
 *   <li>After all subsystem periodic methods have run, scheduled commands are executed, which may
 *       update the states of subsystems or state machines.
 *   <li>Whenever a state is updated using {@link #setState(S)}, the state machine attempts to
 *       transition to the new state immediately. This evaluation happens instantly upon calling
 *       {@link #setState(S)}, not during the next periodic loop, allowing the controls to be
 *       immediately updated.
 * </ol>
 *
 * @param <S> All possible states for this state machine.
